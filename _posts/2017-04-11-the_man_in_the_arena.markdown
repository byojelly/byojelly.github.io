"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who
is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives
valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without
error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great
enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best
knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least
fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls
who neither know victory nor defeat." 
                                                       ~Theodore Roosevelt
                                                         April 23, 1910
																												 Paris, France


My decision to pursue computer science and software design stems from the excitement and courage that these words instill in me.  Roosevelt's quote "The Man In the Arena" comes from his speech "Citizenship in the Republic" which he gave to an audience in Paris, France after his term as President of the United States.  This speech, was aimed towards instilling passion to men and women against cynics who look adversely at others who attempt to make the world a better place. 

Over the last 10 years, I have witnessed the technological and entrepreneurial innovations as an observer.  Recently however, I have made the decision to contribute in this arena rather than observe. Although probability shows that I may never create the next big thing in software, I do not want this to limit my educational or creative pursuits of understanding computer science. Today I look to be the man in the arena, rather than be an observer in the crowd.
