Two weeks ago my brother and I met in Washington, DC to attend the March for Science!  Through the  rain and cold we marched alongside thousands of other concerned citizens from the Washington Monument to the US Capital building while having an amazing time.  The event was organized with speeches from scientists, activists, and private citizens expressing their concern and support for continued funding for scientific research, fact based legislation, and promoting science literacy.  Even better, the march was an opportunity to celebrate our primal human instinct for exploration and seeking answers to the unkown.  We met people from all over the country who shared their research and stories of how science has influenced their lives. I even had the opportunity to see my favorite scientist. Beeker.

Regardless of your political affiliation, it was a fantastic experience with a great message.


Since my last blog I have learned many different coding topics through the curriculum including basic fundamentals of ruby, github, html, and css.  My lastest lab went into detail with using Yield and Blocks in ruby.  This topic seems complicated now but I am sure it will become more intuitive in future lessons.  My coursework so far has been very rewarding and I have loved being able to learn to code. 

Over the weekend I tackled my most difficult lesson so far which was not even apart of my coursework.  This weekend I downloaded a new operating software onto my computer in order to have a local testing environment.  Learn.co provides an integrated development environment (IDE) on their own servers called the Learn IDE.  This platform is very useful for Learn.co students as it seamlessly integrates itself into the lessons and labs.  The pitfall of the Learn IDE however is that it if Learn.co has issues with their servers, your progress in the course comes to a standstill for submitting and progressing through your coursework.  As fate would have it Learn.co had issues with their servers last week which delayed my progress.  After speaking with a few classmates in the program, I learned that you can install a local environment onto your laptop using Atom (which is what the Learn IDE is based on) which would resolve the issues with the servers if they go down again.  I also learned that installing a local environment was valuable for adjusting faster to the coding environment that will most likely be used in the real world and industry after completing the Learn.co program.

In order to setup the local environment onto my windows based laptop, I had to install a Linux desktop interface called Ubuntu onto my laptop so that Atom can run properly.  This is much easier said than done.  I spent the weekend reading tutorial after tutorial for conditioning my current laptop’s hard ware (known as partitioning) to be able to support Ubuntu and then implementing the software.  Some tutorials were very helpful while others were not because of software updates that were not reflected in the instructions.

After many hours of research and setting up the system, I now have a local programming environment (Atom) setup on my Linux based operating system (Ubuntu).  So far I could not be happier with the operating system.  The os’ interaction with Learn.co requires more terminal based command prompts to activate Atom rather than having everything all-inclusive in the Learn IDE.   Even better all of my programs seem to be running much cleaner and faster using Ubuntu.  Before switching my OS, I was using Windows 10. Although windows 10 is not completely gone off my hard drive, I am happier so far using Ubuntu. 

Although I still have quite the learning curve ahead of me with Ubuntu, I hope things continue to go smoothly as I navigate this new OS.

Until next time.
